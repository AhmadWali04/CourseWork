Sum integers function:
this method utilizes the scanf method, which scans the users input
and stores it as a value. Here we use it to create a variable called num
if we have a number, add it to the total, otherweise break.

Sum Three integers:
now the scanf method declares 3 variables, num1,num 2 and num3
if we get anything other than whats considered valid form the get char method, 
we ask for another input. \n means a new line.

int_array_read:
we take a pointer to an array as a parameter and have a size.
the fgets method works by taking contents from a file and reading it up until the line breaks.

We creata character array of 50 spaces to store all the inputs. We create a branch in our code that 
handles any input/output errors. Checks if reading a standard input (stdin) from fgets was successfull
if it wasnt we know we had an error and print it. 

Otherwise, assuming no error, we take the value and assign it to a new index in the array. This is referenced
by using pointer notation. Otherwise, we have an invalid input.
